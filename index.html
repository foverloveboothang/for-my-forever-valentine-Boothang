<h2>The Day We Met</h2>
<p>We met at work when I was asked to train you on the job. The moment I saw you, something in me shifted. I knew there was something special about you. You didn’t like my first vibe, and you were even annoyed by me. But I kept trying. I kept showing up. And then the day you left the company, we happened to go home together. That simple walk changed everything. That was the beginning of us — and my dream slowly started becoming real.</p>

<h2>Our First Date</h2>
<p>On our first day out, we agreed to go bowling. I was excited and nervous at the same time. It turned out to be such a beautiful day. We bowled, we shopped, we explored, and we laughed. I still remember how good you were at bowling. That day will always mean something special to me.</p>

<h2>Our Journey</h2>
<p>From strangers to lovers. From simple conversations to deep connection. Our journey has been filled with growth, patience, laughter, and learning each other more every day.</p>

<h2>Our Ups and Downs</h2>
<p>We have had our small disagreements — even about Raila and Ruto. We once slept mad at each other and argued again in the morning. But even in those moments, we never stopped choosing each other. We always found our way back.</p>

<h2>Just Between Us</h2>
<p>We keep gossiping at events, giving tea about people around us until you joke that one day someone will beat us. Those small playful moments are part of what makes us, us.</p>
